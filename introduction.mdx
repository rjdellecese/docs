<Warning>
  Confect is pre-1.0 and its API is not yet stable.
</Warning>

Confect is a framework that deeply integrates [Effect](https://effect.website/) with [Convex](https://convex.dev/). It's more than just Effect bindings! Confect allows you to:

* Define your Convex database schema using Effect schemas.

* Use Confect functions to automatically decode and encode your data according to your Effect schema definitions when reading from and writing to the database.

* Write Convex function `args` and `returns` validators using Effect's Schema library.

* Use Effect-ified versions of all of the Convex server APIs (`Promise`s become `Effects`, `A | null`s becomes `Option<A>`s, etc.).

It's recommended that you have some familiarity with both Effect and Convex, including the vanilla `convex-js` APIs, before getting started with Confect.
